### Who am I

💻 I am currently working as a Senior DevOps Engineer.

☁️ Experienced in AWS, GCP, and cloud-native architectures.

🐧 Proficient in Linux system administration and automation.

⚙️ Skilled in CI/CD pipelines, containerization (Docker, Kubernetes), and Infrastructure as Code (Terraform, Ansible).

🔍 Passionate about building secure, scalable, and highly available systems.

📊 Adept at monitoring, logging, and performance optimization using modern observability tools.

💬 Ask me about DevOps, AWS, Linux, GCP, and cloud migration strategies.

### **About Me:**

I’m a passionate Senior DevOps Engineer with 8 yrs of experience having a strong focus on automation, scalability, and reliability. Over the years, I’ve helped businesses streamline their deployment processes, migrate to the cloud with minimal downtime, and build infrastructure that can handle growth with confidence.

I specialize in AWS, GCP, Linux systems, and modern DevOps practices like CI/CD pipelines, container orchestration, and Infrastructure as Code. My approach combines technical expertise with a problem-solving mindset, ensuring that every solution I design is not just functional, but efficient and secure.

When I’m not optimizing deployments or tuning servers, you’ll find me exploring emerging tech trends, contributing to open-source projects, or automating tedious tasks just for the fun of it.
